# Learn-Code-Save-Python-Series

## Introduction
Welcome to **Learn, Code, Save: Python**, a series designed to dive deep into the logic behind commonly used Python functions and methods. This repository bridges the gap between knowing **what a function does** and understanding **how it works internally**.

Many educational resources teach what functions do but rarely delve into the underlying logic. This series aims to demystify those functions by writing backend logic to replicate their behavior.

## Purpose
The goal of this series is to help Python enthusiasts, learners, and students gain:
- A **deeper understanding of Python functions** and how they operate internally.
- Insights into **building custom solutions** by implementing backend logic.
- Knowledge to **think critically about code logic**, making you a better problem-solver.

## What You Will Find
This series will cover backend logic for various Python functions and concepts, such as:

1. **Data Manipulation Functions:**
   - `fillna()` in pandas â€“ Replace missing values with custom logic.
   - `groupby()` â€“ Understand how data is aggregated.

2. **Directory and File Handling:**
   - `os.walk()` â€“ Explore how file systems can be navigated.

3. **Comparisons and Conditional Logic:**
   - Difference between `is` and `==` in Python.
   - Best practices for using `__name__ == "__main__"`.

4. **Decorators and Functional Programming:**
   - `@staticmethod` vs `@classmethod`
   - Understanding `lambda` functions.

5. **Data Structures and Utilities:**
   - `setdefault()` in dictionaries.
   - Replicating `zip()` functionality manually.

6. **Performance and Memory Management:**
   - Circular references and garbage collection.

## Why This Series Matters
Most educational courses or tutorials provide only high-level information about functions. They often skip explaining the internal logic or how functions can be manually implemented. This series fills that gap by showing how basic functions work step-by-step, making it easier for learners to:
- Build problem-solving skills.
- Develop a deeper coding mindset.
- Write more efficient and optimized code.

## Series Structure
Each entry in the series will include:
1. **Function Explanation:** What the function does and its practical use.
2. **Backend Logic:** Step-by-step custom logic replicating the function.
3. **Code Examples:** Ready-to-run code with comments.
4. **Use Cases:** Practical scenarios where the function can be applied.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yasayah-Nadeem-Khokhar/Learn-Code-Save-Python-Series
   ```
2. Navigate through individual notebook files or scripts.
3. Run the code examples and experiment with the custom logic.
